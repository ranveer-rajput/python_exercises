# Metadata
- Level: 1
- Title: Factorial Calculator
- Topics: Functions, Recursion, Input/Output

# Instructions
Write a function called `calculate_factorial(n)` that computes the factorial of a given number `n`.
The function should return the factorial value.

# How to Test
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_ex_03
```

# Hints
- Factorial of n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n
- Factorial of 0 is 1
- You can use recursion or a loop to calculate the factorial
- Make sure to handle cases like negative inputs
- Make sure you are converting the input to an integer

# Notes
- Do not remove or rename `calculate_factorial()`, it's required and should not be altered
- You can create your own helper functions if needed
