## Metadata
- Level: 2
- Title: Sum of Squares
- Topics: Math, Loops, Code Optimization

## Instructions
Write a function `sum_of_squares(num: int) -> int` to find sum of squares from `0` to `num` (inclusive),
then return it. Don't forget to optimize for performance.

## Example

Input: 4
Output: 30
Explanation: 0^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 = 30

## How to Test

Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python -m unittest tests.test_ex_11
```

## Hints

- Search for in-build function provided by python to perform addition.

## Notes

- Do not remove or rename `sum_of_squares(num)`.
- You can create helper functions if needed.
